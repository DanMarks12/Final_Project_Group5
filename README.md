# Final_Project_Group5: An Analysis into the Tech Sector before and after Covid:
The uncertainty that COVID has brought to various industries around the world has seemingly overlooked or enriched certain sectors. Tech in particular has been able to flourish during pandemic,in part due to many business moving from office workplace to employees working from home; schools moving to remote learning and public transportation shifting to private rides and other forms of transportation. Our goal in our final project is to take a look at the impact covid has had on the Tech industry, and where we expect it to go moving forward.

## Questions:

#### Have tech stocks outperformed other sectors since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic?

Hypothesis: the large cap stocks in the tech sector have outperformed stocks in other industries during the Covid-19 pandemic as a combination of less reliance on brick-and-mortar retail and more need for electronic communication have inoculated them against the economic fallout of the pandemic.

#### Have established tech companies outperformed their younger rivals during the Covid-19 pandemic?

Hypothesis: there is traditionally a premium associated with smaller and newer companies as they have more room to grow. However, they are also riskier investments. During the Covid-19 pandemic, blue chip stocks outperformed their less-established counterparts because they had more cash on-hand to survive the economic disruption of the pandemic. 

#### The Rise of SPACs: Which has been more succesful SPACs or IPO during covid
