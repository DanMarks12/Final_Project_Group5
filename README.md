## The Rise of SPACs: During Covid, SPACs have become more popular. Since the vaccine released, which have been proven to be more successful (performing better in the market) -- IPOs or SPACs?

Hypothesis:

SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Corporations) are essentially shell corporations that form with the intention of purchasing a private corporation. It is an alternate method of taking a corporation public with less red tape than an IPO. The SPAC has existed for several decades, but has gained a great deal of attention lately. Despite the buzz around SPACs, they have generated less return for investors than IPOs because this alternate method of going public signals to markets some underlying issue in the companyâ€™s fiscal health.
