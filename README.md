# Final_Project_Group5

## Role Week 1: Github
See Main branch for other commits/week 1 Github progress

## Role Week 2-3: 
Kept Github up to date, created DBD to be used in other questions/ validating stock picks for my question. Created a Linear Regression Model and a ML model for 1 stock each before performing analysis on all 10 stocks. 

##### ML using DecisionTreeClassifier

## Question: Startup Tech Companies vs Bluechip/Established: Analysis on performance and profitability: 
#### Hypothesis: Blue chip companies will have safer more controlled growth whereas startups with have more volitality, higher risk but also higher gains in positive cases and losses in negative cases. In the case of my question I believe Blue chip tech stocks will have more accurate models than new IPO stocks. 

#### Method: I will be running 1/2 ML methods on each stock as well as a simple Linear Regression model and comparing their scores.

## Stocks for my question
Our top 5 bluechip/recent ipo/SPAC companies were chosen because of two metrics: Tech sector and highest market cap as of 5/1/2021
