# Final_Project_Group5: An Analysis into the Tech Sector before and after Covid:
The uncertainty that COVID has brought to various industries around the world has seemingly overlooked or enriched certain sectors. Tech in particular has been able to flourish during pandemic,in part due to many business moving from office workplace to employees working from home; schools moving to remote learning and public transportation shifting to private rides and other forms of transportation. Our goal in our final project is to take a look at the impact covid has had on the Tech industry, and where we expect it to go moving forward.

## Questions:

#### Are tech companies' worthwhile investment with long-term growth potential?

Hypothesis: 

#### ML Question: Can we predict the big 5 tech stocks more accurately than tech companys that IPOd after 2019?

Hypothesis: Blue chip companies will have safer more controlled growth whereas startups with have more volitality, higher risk but also higher gains in positive cases and losses in negative cases 

#### The Rise of SPACs: During Covid, SPACs have become more popular. Since the vaccine released, which have been proven to be more successful (performing better in the market) -- IPOs or SPACs?

Hypothesis: 

#### How did tech compnies manage during covid, some flourished, while others fell. Were different subsectors of tech hit differently?

Hypothesis: Tech stocks have surged during covid and helped the stock market rise. The pandemic has fueled the tech stocks while hurting other industries like the airline industry.

#### Is there a positive correlation between a companys ethical practices and profitability?

Hypothesis:
