# Final_Project_Group5

## Purpose 

In this analysis, the machine learning model required five blue-chip stocks that IPO'd before 2013 and five stocks that IPO'd after 2018 to answer whether blue-chip stock prices can be forecasted better than newer companies using machine learning. To remove bias in the stock-picking process, SQL was used to filter out the stocks needed based on the IPO year and market cap.
