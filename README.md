# Final_Project_Group5: An Analysis into the Tech Sector before and after Covid:
The uncertainty that COVID has brought to various industries around the world has seemingly overlooked or enriched certain sectors. Tech in particular has been able to flourish during pandemic,in part due to many business moving from office workplace to employees working from home; schools moving to remote learning and public transportation shifting to private rides and other forms of transportation. Our goal in our final project is to take a look at the impact covid has had on the Tech industry, and where we expect it to go moving forward.

## Questions:

#### Have tech stocks outperformed other sectors since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic?

Hypothesis: the large cap stocks in the tech sector have outperformed stocks in other industries during the Covid-19 pandemic as a combination of less reliance on brick-and-mortar retail and more need for electronic communication have inoculated them against the economic fallout of the pandemic.

#### Have established tech companies outperformed their younger rivals during the Covid-19 pandemic?

Hypothesis: there is traditionally a premium associated with smaller and newer companies as they have more room to grow. However, they are also riskier investments. During the Covid-19 pandemic, blue chip stocks outperformed their less-established counterparts because they had more cash on-hand to survive the economic disruption of the pandemic. 

#### Have SPACs overtaken IPOs for investor returns in the tech sector?

Hypothesis: SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Corporations) are essentially shell corporations that form with the intention of purchasing a private corporation. It is an alternate method of taking a corporation public with less red tape than an IPO. The SPAC has existed for several decades, but has gained a great deal of attention lately. Despite the buzz around SPACs, they have generated less return for investors than IPOs because this alternate method of going public signals to markets some underlying issue in the companyâ€™s fiscal health.

#### How have different sub-sectors of the tech industry performed during the Covid-19 pandemic? 

Hypothesis: certain sub-sectors of the tech industry have generated smaller returns to shareholders because of greater exposure to the economic risks associated with Covid-19. Semiconductor manufacturers suffered lower returns because of greater supply chain disruption. Meanwhile, social media companies have reaped the rewards of a world that is now fully reliant on the Internet for social interaction.

#### Have tech stocks with higher ESG scores generated higher returns during the Covid-19 pandemic?

Hypothesis: companies with better ESG scores (environmental, social, governance) have performed better during the Covid-19 pandemic. In a chaotic world, consumers are more likely to support charitable corporations. Furthermore, companies that have better accommodated employees during the pandemic by providing more sick leave, greater remote work opportunities, and bonuses have reaped the rewards of greater employee morale and productivity.
